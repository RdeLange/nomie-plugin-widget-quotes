## How to use the üí¨Nomie Quotes Plugin

After installing the Plugin, please open the plugin to initialise the plugin and configure your first list of quotes.

Due to the setup of the Nomie plugin engine, the plugin should be openened first in order to be able to add Quotes widgets to your dashboard.

When the plugin is opened you will be presented with an empty dashboard:
